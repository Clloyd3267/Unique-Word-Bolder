If anyone hears my words ...$But does not keep them, I do not judge that person. For I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world. There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words; the very words I have spoken will condemn them at the last day.
A new command I give ...$you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another. 
And I will ask the ...$Father, and he will give you another advocate to help you and be with you forever -- the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you.
I will not say much ...$More to you, for the prince of this world is coming. He has no hold over me, but he comes so that the world may learn that I love the Father and do exactly what my Father has commanded me. Come now; let us leave.
Greater love has no one ...$Than this: to lay down one's life for one's friends. You are my friends if you do what I command.
They will put you out ...$Of the synagogue; in fact, the time is coming when anyone who kills you will think they are offering a service to God. They will do such things because they have not known the Father or me.
My prayer is not for ...$Them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me.
I have given them the ...$Glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one -- I in them and you in me -- so that they may be brought to complete unity. Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me.
The chief priests of the ...$Jews protested to Pilate, "Do not write 'The King of the Jews,' but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews. Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."
The soldiers twisted together ...$A crown of thorns and put it on his head. They clothed him in a purple robe and went up to him again and again, saying, "Hail, king of the Jews!" And they slapped him in the face.
Early on the first day ...$Of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance. So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved, and said, "They have taken the Lord out of the
Jesus performed many other signs ...$In the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book. But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.
Then the disciple whom Jesus ...$Loved said to Peter, "It is the Lord!" As soon as Simon Peter heard him say, "It is the Lord," he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the water. The other disciples followed in the boat, towing the net full of fi
Leave her alone, Jesus replied. ...$It was intended that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial."
Jesus replied, The hour has ...$Come for the Son of Man to be glorified."
Very truly I tell you, ...$Unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds.
Anyone who loves their life ...$Will lose it, while anyone who hates their life in this world will keep it for eternal life.
Whoever serves me must follow ...$Me; and where I am, my servant also will be. My Father will honor the one who serves me.
Now my soul is troubled, ...$And what shall I say? "Father, save me from this hour"? No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour.
Father, glorify your name! Then ...$A voice came from heaven, "I have glorified it, and will glorify it again."
And I, when I am ...$lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself. 
Believe in the light while ...$You have the light, so that you may become children of light." When he had finished speaking, Jesus left and hid himself from them.
This was to fulfill the ...$Word of Isaiah the prophet: "Lord, who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?"
He has blinded their eyes ...$And hardened their hearts, so they can neither see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, nor turn -- and I would heal them. 
Yet at the same time ...$Many even among the leaders believed in him. But because of the Pharisees they would not openly acknowledge their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue;
For they loved human praise ...$More than praise from God.
Then Jesus cried out,Whoever ...$Believes in me does not believe in me only, but in the one who sent me."
I have come into the ...$World as a light, so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness.
If anyone hears my words ...$But does not keep them, I do not judge that person. For I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world.
There is a judge for ...$The one who rejects me and does not accept my words; the very words I have spoken will condemn them at the last day.
I know that his command ...$Leads to eternal life. So whatever I say is just what the Father has told me to say. 
It was just before the ...$Passover Festival. Jesus knew that the hour had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.
After that, he poured water ...$Into a basin and began to wash his disciples' feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.
Jesus answered,Those who have ...$Had a bath need only to wash their feet; their whole body is clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you." 
You call meTeacher and ...$"Lord," and rightly so, for that is what I am.
Now that I, your Lord ...$And Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another's feet.
Jesus answered,It is the ...$One to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish." Then, dipping the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.
A new command I give ...$you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.
By this everyone will know ...$That you are my disciples, if you love one another. 
Then Jesus answered,Will you ...$Really lay down your life for me? Very truly I tell you, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times!"
Do not let your hearts ...$Be troubled. You believe in God; believe also in me.
My Father's house has many ...$Rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you?
And if I go and ...$Prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am.
Jesus answered,I am the ...$Way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."
Don't you believe that ...$I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you I do not speak on my own authority. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work.
And I will do whatever ...$You ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
You may ask me for ...$Anything in my name, and I will do it.
If you love me, keep ...$My commands.
And I will ask the ...$Father, and he will give you another advocate to help you and be with you forever.
Whoever has my commands and ...$Keeps them is the one who loves me. The one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love them and show myself to them. 
Jesus replied,Anyone who loves ...$Me will obey my teaching. My Father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them.
Anyone who does not love ...$Me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me.
But the Advocate, the Holy ...$Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.
Peace I leave with you; ...$My peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.
You heard me say, ...$"I am going away and I am coming back to you." If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I.
I am the true vine, ...$And my Father is the gardener.
He cuts off every branch ...$In me that bears no fruit, while every branch that does bear fruit he prunes so that it will be even more fruitful.
Remain in me, as ...$I also remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me.
I am the vine; you ...$Are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.
If you do not remain ...$In me, you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned.
If you remain in me ...$And my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.
This is to my Father's ...$Glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples.
As the Father has loved ...$Me, so have I loved you. Now remain in my love.
If you keep my commands, ...$You will remain in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commands and remain in his love.
I have told you this ...$So that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete.
My command is this: Love ...$Each other as I have loved you.
Greater love has no one ...$Than this: to lay down one's life for one's friends.
You are my friends if ...$You do what I command.
I no longer call you ...$Servants, because a servant does not know his master's business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you.
You did not choose me, ...$But I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit ”fruit that will last ”and so that whatever you ask in my name the Father will give you.
This is my command: Love ...$Each other.
If the world hates you, ...$Keep in mind that it hated me first.
If you belonged to the ...$world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you.
Remember what I told you: ...$"A servant is not greater than his master." If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also. If they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours also.
Whoever hates me hates my ...$Father as well.
When the Advocate comes, whom ...$I will send to you from the Father -- the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father -- he will testify about me.
They will put you out ...$Of the synagogue; in fact, the time is coming when anyone who kills you will think they are offering a service to God.
But very truly I tell ...$You, it is for your good that I am going away. Unless I go away, the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.
But when he, the Spirit ...$Of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come.
Jesus went on to say, ...$"In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me."
In that day you will ...$No longer ask me anything. Very truly I tell you, my Father will give you whatever you ask in my name.
Until now you have not ...$Asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive, and your joy will be complete.
No, the Father himself loves ...$You because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God.
I came from the Father ...$And entered the world; now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father. 
I have told you these ...$Things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world. 
Now this is eternal life: ...$That they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.
And now, Father, glorify me ...$In your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began.
I have revealed you ...$To those whom you gave me out of the world. They were yours; you gave them to me and they have obeyed your word.
For I gave them the ...$Words you gave me and they accepted them. They knew with certainty that I came from you, and they believed that you sent me.
All I have is yours, ...$And all you have is mine. And glory has come to me through them.
I will remain in the ...$World no longer, but they are still in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them by the power of your name, the name you gave me, so that they may be one as we are one.
My prayer is not that ...$You take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one.
Sanctify them by the truth; ...$Your word is truth.
As you sent me into ...$The world, I have sent them into the world.
My prayer is not for ...$Them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message,
that all of them may ...$be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me.
I have given them the ...$Glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one.
Father, I want those you ...$Have given me to be with me where I am, and to see my glory, the glory you have given me because you loved me before the creation of the world.
When Jesus said,I am ...$He," they drew back and fell to the ground.
Jesus commanded Peter,Put your ...$Sword away! Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given me?"
You aren't one of this ...$Man's disciples too, are you?" she asked Peter. He replied, "I am not."
I have spoken openly ...$To the world," Jesus replied. "I always taught in synagogues or at the temple, where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret."
Meanwhile, Simon Peter was still ...$Standing there warming himself. So they asked him, "You aren't one of his disciples too, are you?" He denied it, saying, "I am not."
Again Peter denied it, and ...$At that moment a rooster began to crow.
Jesus said,My kingdom is ...$Not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jewish leaders. But now my kingdom is from another place." 
You are a king, then! …$Said Pilate. Jesus answered, "You say that I am a king. In fact, the reason I was born and came into the world is to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me."
What is truth? retorted Pilate. ...$With this he went out again to the Jews gathered there and said, "I find no basis for a charge against him."
Then Pilate took Jesus and ...$Had him flogged.
As soon as the chief ...$Priests and their officials saw him, they shouted, "Crucify! Crucify!" But Pilate answered, "You take him and crucify him. As for me, I find no basis for a charge against him."
The Jewish leaders insisted,We ...$Have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God."
Jesus answered,You would have ...$No power over me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin."
From then on, Pilate tried ...$To set Jesus free, but the Jewish leaders kept shouting, "If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar."
Carrying his own cross, he ...$Went out to the place of the Skull (which in Aramaic is called Golgotha).
There they crucified him, and ...$With him two others -- one on each side and Jesus in the middle.
Pilate had a notice prepared ...$And fastened to the cross. It read: Jesus of Nazareth, the king of the Jews.
Later, knowing that everything had ...$Now been finished, and so that Scripture would be fulfilled, Jesus said, "I am thirsty."
When he had received the ...$drink, Jesus said, "It is finished." With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.
Now it was the day ...$of Preparation, and the next day was to be a special Sabbath. Because the Jewish leaders did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down.
These things happened so that ...$The scripture would be fulfilled: "Not one of his bones will be broken."
And, as another scripture says, ...$"They will look on the one they have pierced."
Later, Joseph of Arimathea asked ...$Pilate for the body of Jesus. Now Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly because he feared the Jewish leaders. With Pilate's permission, he came and took the body away.
Taking Jesus' body, the two ...$Of them wrapped it, with the spices, in strips of linen. This was in accordance with Jewish burial customs.
Early on the first day ...$Of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance.
So she came running to ...$Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved, and said, "They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have put him!"
Finally the other disciple, who ...$Had reached the tomb first, also went inside. He saw and believed.
They asked her,Woman, why ...$Are you crying?" "They have taken my Lord away," she said, "and I don't know where they have put him."
Jesus said,Do not hold ...$On to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'"
Mary Magdalene went to the ...$With the news: "I have seen the Lord!" And she told them that he had said these things to her.
On the evening of that ...$First day of the week, when the disciples were together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jewish leaders, Jesus came and stood among them and said, "Peace be with you!"
Again Jesus said,Peace be ...$With you! As the Father has sent me, I am sending you."
And with that he breathed ...$On them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit."
If you forgive anyone's sins, ...$Their sins are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven. 
So the other disciples told ...$Him, "We have seen the Lord!" But he said to them, "Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe."
Then he said to Thomas, ...$"Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe."
Then Jesus told him,Because ...$You have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."
But these are written that ...$You may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.
I'm going out to fish,$Simon Peter told them, and they said, "We'll go with you." So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.
He said,Throw your net ...$On the right side of the boat and you will find some."  When they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish.
Jesus said to them,Come$And have breakfast." None of the disciples dared ask him, "Who are you?" They knew it was the Lord.
Jesus came, took the bread ...$And gave it to them, and did the same with the fish.
This was now the third ...$Time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead.
When they had finished eating, ...$Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?" "Yes, Lord," he said, "you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Feed my lambs."
The third time he said ...$To him, "Simon son of John, do you love me?" Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, "Do you love me?" He said, "Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Feed my sheep."
Jesus said this to indicate ...$The kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. Then he said to him, "Follow me!"
This is the disciple who ...$Testifies to these things and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true.
Jesus did many other things ...$As well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.
